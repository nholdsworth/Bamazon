This homework should have been easy but for some reason it wasn't.  I don't lnow why I am getting that error message about if (error) throw error.

anyway, I tried twice to build this homework and I kept the commented out code.  I tried to use the solution for greatbay as a template but that didn't work and then I got some help from my study group on Monday with Ray and Kristen and it was working better than it is now then.

I am including this screen shot to show how far I got and where it broke down.  I know it is something simple probably but I also know this weeks homework is much harder so I wanted to get started on that.

Please use bamazon.js not bamazon2.js to see all my struggles
